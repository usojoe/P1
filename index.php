		<h2>In two sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
		<p>I am a multimedia journalist for the USO (United Services Organization) and my job is basically to report to the American people about the day-to-day goodness provided by their congressionally chartered nonprofit. I'm working on an ALM in Journalism at the extension school, and I should graduate next spring. Before working at the USO I was an active duty Marine Combat Correspondent for approximately 10 years.</p>
		
		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>My primary reason for taking this course is to complete a certificate in web technologies, which I expect will round out my journalism experience and education moving forward into the next few decades.</p>
		
		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p>My actual programming experience is limited to basic HTML and CSS for the most part, except I have a lot of experience with PHP and MySQL pre-packaged Content Management Systems and web forums.</p>
		
		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p>I am working 100 percent on Mac, but I have a background in PC as well.</p>
		
		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
		<p>That's pretty much it. I like long walks on the beach and not pulling my hair out all night doing coding homework.</p>
